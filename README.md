Blog
====

This is a blogging engine I'm making to teach myself Ruby on Rails.  It features TypeAhead article tagging, a Javascript Rich Text Editor, and a Bootstrap 3 interface.

Planned features include user favorites.

I'm designing it to be a baking and cooking blog, since they are two of my favorite hobbies.  But it would be easy to do anything else with it.
